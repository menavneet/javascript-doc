        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Writing JavaScript code in an HTML page</strong>: We must enclose the JavaScript code within the
            &lt;script&gt; tag in order to include it on an HTML page just as the example shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript hljs">&lt;script type = <span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
    <span class="hljs-comment">//JavaScript coding can be done inside this tag</span>
    &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>With this information, the browser can correctly make out that the code is written in JavaScript and execute
          the code.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Inclusion of external JavaScript files in an HTML file</strong>: An external JavaScript file can
            also be written separately and included within our HTML file. That way, different types of code can be kept
            isolated from one another, resulting in better-organised files. For instance, if our JavaScript code is
            written in the file script.js, we can include it in our HTML file in the following way:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs">&lt;script src=<span class="hljs-string">"script.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage of Comments in JavaScript coding:</strong> Comments are extremely useful in programming
            because they can assist others to understand what's going on in your code or they can help you if you have
            forgotten something. Keep in mind that they must be correctly identified so that the browser does not
            attempt to execute them. There are two alternatives available in JavaScript in which we can add comments:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Single-line comments:</strong> If you want to include a single line comment, start it with "//".
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multi-line comments</strong>: If you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, you can
                wrap it in /* and */ to prevent it from being executed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h3>2. Javascript Variables</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Variables in JavaScript are simply names of storage locations. In other words, they can be considered as
          stand-in values that we can use to perform various operations in our JavaScript codes. JavaScript allows the
          usage of variables in the following three ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>var</strong>: The most commonly used variable in JavaScript is var. It can be redeclared and its
            value can be reassigned, but only inside the context of a function. When the JavaScript code is run,
            variables defined using var are moved to the top. An example of a variable declared using the "var" keyword
            in JavaScript is shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">140</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">//  variable x can be reassigned a new value and also redeclared</span></code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>const</strong>: const variables in JavaScript cannot be used before they appear in the code. They
            can neither be reassigned values, that is, their value remains fixed throughout the execution of the code,
            nor can they be redeclared. An example of a variable declared using the "const" keyword in JavaScript is
            shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// variable x cannot be reassigned a new value or redeclared</span></code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>let</strong>: The let variable, like const, cannot be redeclared. But they can be reassigned a
            value. An example of a variable declared using the "let" keyword in JavaScript is shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">202</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// variable x cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned a new value</span></code></pre>

      <h3>3. Javascript Data Types</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Different types of values and data can be stored in JavaScript variables. To assign values to JavaScript
          variables, you use the equals to "=" sign operator. The various data types in JavaScript are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers: These are just numerical values. They can be real numbers or integers. An example of the numbers
            data type is shown below: <code>var id = 100</code>
          </li>
          <li>Variables: The variable data type, as the name suggests, does not have a fixed value. An example of the
            variables data type is shown below: <code>var y</code>
          </li>
          <li>Text (strings): String data types of JavaScript are a combination of multiple characters. An example of
            the string data type is shown below: <code>var demoString = "Hello World"</code>
          </li>
          <li>Operations: Operations in JavaScript can also be assigned to JavaScript variables. An example of these is
            shown below: <code>var sum = 20 + 30 + 29</code>
          </li>
          <li>Boolean values: Boolean values can be true or false. An example of the boolean data type is shown below:
            <code>var booleanValue = true</code>
          </li>
          <li>Constant numbers: As the name suggests, these data types have a fixed value. An example of the constant
            data type is shown below: <code>const g = 9.8</code>
          </li>
          <li>Objects: JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties. They possess their own data
            members and methods. An example of the objects data type is shown
            below:<br><code>var name = {name:"Jon Snow", id:"AS123"}</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note: It is important to remember that variables in JavaScript are case-sensitive. As a result, "small" and
            "Small" will be treated as separate variables in JavaScript.</p>

      <h3>4. JavaScript Operators</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>You can use variables to conduct a variety of tasks using JavaScript operators. The various types of
          operators in JavaScript are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fundamental Operators</strong>: These operators are used to perform basic operations like addition,
            multiplication, etc. in JavaScript. A list of all the Fundamental operators in JavaScript is as follows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>+</strong>: The Addition Operator is used to add two numbers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>-</strong>: The Subtraction Operator is used to subtract two numbers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>*</strong>: The MultiplicationOperator is used to multiply two numbers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>/</strong>: The Division Operator is used to divide two numbers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>(...)</strong>: In general, operations within brackets are executed earlier than that outside.
                This grouping operator surrounds an expression or sub-expression with a pair of parentheses to override
                the conventional operator precedence, allowing operators with lower precedence to be evaluated before
                operators with higher precedence. It does exactly what it says: it groups the contents of the
                parentheses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>%</strong>: The Modulus operator is used to get the remainder when an integer number is divided
                by another integer number.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>++</strong>: The Increment operator is used to increase the value of numbers by one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>--</strong>: The Decrement operator is used to decrease the value of numbers by one.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bitwise Operators</strong>: &nbsp;All the operations dealing with the bits of the numbers can be
            performed by the bitwise operators in JavaScript. A list of all the Bitwise operators in JavaScript is as
            follows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>&amp;</strong>: The bitwise AND operator returns a 1 in every bit position where both operands'
                corresponding bits are 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>|</strong>: &nbsp;The bitwise OR operator (|) returns a 1 in each bit position where either or
                both operands' corresponding bits are 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>~</strong>: The bitwise NOT operator reverses the operand's bits. It turns the operand into a
                32-bit signed integer, just like other bitwise operators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>^</strong>: The bitwise XOR operator () returns a 1 in each bit position where the corresponding
                bits of both operands are 1s but not both.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>: The left shift operator shifts the first operand to the left by the provided
                number of bits. Extra bits that have been relocated to the left are discarded. From the right, zero bits
                are shifted in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>: The right shift operator (&gt;&gt;) moves the first operand to the right by
                the provided number of bits. Extra bits that have been relocated to the right are discarded. The
                leftmost bit's copies are shifted in from the left. The sign bit (the leftmost bit) does not change
                since the new leftmost bit has the same value as the old leftmost bit. As a result, the term
                "sign-propagating" was coined.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> &nbsp;A list of all the Comparison operators in JavaScript is as
            follows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>==</strong>: The equality operator (==) returns a Boolean value when its two operands are equal.
                It tries to convert and compare operands of different kinds, unlike the rigorous equivalent operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>===</strong>: The equivalent operator (===) returns a Boolean value when its two operands are
                equal and they have the same type. It tries to convert and compare operands of the same kinds, unlike
                the equality operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>!=</strong>: The inequality operator (!=) returns a Boolean value if the two operands are not
                equal. It tries to convert and compare operands of different kinds, unlike the rigorous inequivalent
                operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>!==</strong>: The inequivalent operator (!=) returns a Boolean value if the two operands are not
                equal or they are not of the same type. It tries to convert and compare operands of the same kinds,
                unlike the inequality operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>?</strong>: The conditional (ternary) operator is the only one in JavaScript that takes three
                operands: a condition followed by a question mark (? ), an expression to execute if the condition is
                true followed by a colon (:), and lastly an expression to execute if the condition is false. As an
                alternative to an if...else statement, this operator is commonly used.&gt;: The Greater than operator
                returns true if the operand to its left is greater in value than the operand to its right.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>&lt;</strong>: The Lesser than operator returns true if the operand to its left is lesser in
                value than the operand to its right.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>&gt;=</strong>: The Greater than equals to operator returns true if the operand to its left is
                greater in value or equal in value than the operand to its right.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>&lt;=</strong>: The Lesser than equals to operator returns true if the operand to its left is
                lesser in value or equal in value than the operand to its right.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Logical Operators</strong>: &nbsp;A list of all the Logical operators in JavaScript is as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>: If and only if all of the operands are true, the logical AND operator
                (logical conjunction) for a set of Boolean operands is true. It will be false if it is not. When
                evaluating from left to right, the operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered, or
                the value of the last operand if all operands are truth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>||</strong>: If and only if one or more of its operands are true, the logical OR operator
                (logical disjunction) is true for a set of operands. It's most often used with logical (Boolean) values.
                It returns a Boolean value when this is the case. The || operator, on the other hand, returns the value
                of one of the provided operands, hence using it with non-Boolean values will result in an error.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>!</strong>: The logical NOT operator (logical complement, negation) converts truth to falsity.
                It's most commonly used with logical (Boolean) values. It returns false if its sole operand can be
                transformed to true when used with non-Boolean values; otherwise, it returns true.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>5. JavaScript If-Else Statements</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>The if-else statements are simple to comprehend. You can use them to set conditions for when your code runs.
          If specific requirements are met, something is done; if they are not met, another action is taken. The switch
          statement is a concept that is comparable to if-else. The switch however allows you to choose which of several
          code blocks to run. The syntax of if-else statements in JavaScript is given below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (check condition) {
       <span class="hljs-comment">// block of code to be executed if the given condition is satisfied</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
       <span class="hljs-comment">// block of code to be executed if the given condition is not satisfied</span>
    }</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Loops in JavaScript:</strong></p>
        <p>Most programming languages include loops. They let you run code blocks as many times as you like with
          different values. Loops can be created in a variety of ways in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>the for loop</strong>: The most frequent method of creating a loop in JavaScript. Its syntax is
            shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (initialization <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> the loop variable; condition checking <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the loop; updation after the loop) {
       <span class="hljs-comment">// code to be executed in loop</span>
    }</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>the while loop</strong>: Establishes the conditions under which a loop will run. Its syntax is shown
            below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Initialization of the loop variable is done before the while loop begins</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(condition checking <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the loop){
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 1. code to be executed in loop</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 2. updation of the loop variable</span>
    }</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>the do-while loop</strong>: Similar to the while loop, but it runs at least once and checks at the
            end to see whether the condition is met to run again. Its syntax is shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">// Initialization of the loop variable is done before the do-while loop begins</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 1. code to be executed in loop</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 2. updation of the loop variable</span>
    }<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(condition checking <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the loop);</code></pre>
        <p>There are two statements that are important in the context of loops:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>the continue statement</strong>: Skip parts of the loop if certain conditions are met.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>break statement:</strong> Used to stop and exit the cycle when specific conditions are met.
          </li>

      <h3>6. JavaScript Arrays</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Arrays are the next item on our JavaScript cheat sheet. Arrays are used in a variety of programming
          languages. They are a method of categorising variables and attributes. Arrays can be defined as a collection
          of objects of the same type. In JavaScript, here's how one can make an array of cars:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cars = [<span class="hljs-string">"Mercedes"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Tesla"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"Volvo"</span>];</code></pre>
        <p>Now that we understand how to make arrays, we can perform a bunch of operations on them. Let us take a look
          at some JavaScript methods which can be used to perform various types of operations on arrays:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>pop():</strong> This method is used for removing the last element of an array.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>push(): </strong>This method is used for adding a new element at the very end of an array.

      <h3>7. JavaScript Functions</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>JavaScript Functions can be defined as chunks of code written in JavaScript to perform a single task. A
          function in JavaScript looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">nameOfTheFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-params">parameterOne, parameterTwo, parameterThree, parameterFour,....,parameterN</span>) </span>{
       <span class="hljs-comment">// Job or Task of the function </span>
    }</code></pre>
        <p>The code above consists of the "function" keyword and a name, as you can see. The parameters of the function
          are enclosed in brackets, while the function's task code and output is enclosed in curly brackets. You can
          make your own, but there are a few default functions to make your life easier. Although we will be discussing
          various methods throughout this cheat sheet, let us discuss in brief two important types of JavaScript
          functions in this section:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Functions For Throwing Data As Output</strong>: The output of data is a common application for
            functions. You have the following options for outputting data:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>prompt()</strong>: This function is used for creating a dialogue box for taking input from the
                user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>alert()</strong>: This function is used for outputting information in an alert box in the
                browser window
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>console.log()</strong>: This function is used for writing data to the browser's console and is
                used for the purpose of debugging code by developers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>document.write()</strong>: This function is used for writing straight to our HTML document
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>confirm()</strong>: This function is used for opening up a yes or no dialogue box and for
                returning a boolean value depending upon the user's click
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Functions: </strong>Every browser that can run JavaScript has a set of global functions
            built-in. Some of them are as follows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>parseFloat():</strong> This function is used for parsing the argument passed to it and returning
                a floating-point number.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>parseInt(): </strong>This function is used for parsing the argument passed to it and returning
                an integral number.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>encodeURI():</strong> This function is used for encoding a URI into a UTF-8 encoding scheme.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>decodeURI(): </strong>This function is used for decoding a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
                made by encodeURI() function or similar functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>encodeURIComponent():</strong> This function is used for the same purpose as encodeURI() only
                for URI components.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>decodeURIComponent():</strong> This function is used for decoding a URI component.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>isNaN(): </strong>This function is used for determining if a given value is Not a Number or not.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Number(): </strong>This function is used for returning a number converted from what is passed as
                an argument to it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>eval(): </strong>This function is used for evaluating JavaScript programs presented as strings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>isFinite(): </strong>This function is used for determining if a passed value is finite or not.
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h3>8. Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p><strong>1. Scope:</strong> The accessibility or visibility of variables in JavaScript is referred to as
          scope. That is, which sections of the program can access a given variable and where the variable can be seen.
          There are usually three types of scopes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The global scope includes any variable that is not contained within a
            function or block (a pair of curly braces). Global scope variables can be accessed from anywhere in the
            program. An example showing the global scope of a variable is given below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> hello = <span class="hljs-string">'Hello!'</span>;
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">sayHello</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(hello);
    }
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 'Hello!' gets logged</span>
    sayHello();</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local or Function Scope: </strong>Variables declared inside a function are local variables. They can
            only be accessed from within that function; they are not accessible from outside code. An example showing
            local scope of a variable is given below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">sayHello</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> hello = <span class="hljs-string">'Hello!'</span>;
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(hello);
    }
    <span class="hljs-comment">// 'Hello!' gets logged</span>
    sayHello();</code></pre>
        <p>console.log(hello); // Uncaught ReferenceError: hello is not defined</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Block Scope</strong>: Unlike var variables, let and const variables can be scoped to the nearest
            pair of curly brackets in ES6. They can't be reached from outside that pair of curly braces, which means
            they can't be accessed from the outside. An example showing the block scope of a variable is given below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs">{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> hello = <span class="hljs-string">'Hello!'</span>;
     <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> language = <span class="hljs-string">'Hindi'</span>;
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(hello); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'Hello!' gets logged</span>
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(language); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'Hindi!' gets logged</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(hello); <span class="hljs-comment">// Uncaught ReferenceError: hello is not defined</span></code></pre>
        <p><strong>2. Scope Chain: </strong>When a variable is used in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine searches the
          current scope for the variable's value. If it can't find the variable in the inner scope, it will look into
          the outer scope until it finds it or reaches the global scope.</p>
        <p>If it still can't identify the variable, it will either return an error or implicitly declare the variable in
          the global scope (if not in strict mode). Let us take into consideration the following example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> a = <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>;
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> b = <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>;
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(b); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'b' gets logged</span>
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(a); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'a' gets logged</span>
     randomNumber = <span class="hljs-number">33</span>;
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(randomNumber);  <span class="hljs-comment">// 33 gets logged</span>
    }
    foo();</code></pre>
        <p>When the function foo() is called, the JavaScript engine searches for the 'b' variable in the current scope
          and finds it. Then it looks for the 'a' variable in the current scope, which it can't find, so it moves on to
          the outer scope, where it finds it (i.e global scope).</p>
        <p>After that, we assign 33 to the 'randomNumber' variable, causing the JavaScript engine to search for it first
          in the current scope, then in the outer scope.</p>
        <p>If the script isn't in strict mode, the engine will either create a new variable called randomNumber and
          assign 33 to it, or it will return an error (if not in strict mode).</p>
        <p>As a result, the engine will traverse the scope chain till the time when a variable is found.</p>

      <h3>9. JavaScript Hoisting</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Prior to executing the code, the interpreter appears to relocate the declarations of functions, variables,
          and classes to the top of their scope using a process known as Hoisting in JavaScript. Functions can be
          securely utilised in code before they have been declared thanks to hoisting. Variable and class declarations
          are likewise hoisted, allowing them to be referenced prior to declaration. It should be noted that doing so
          can result in unforeseen mistakes and is not recommended. There are usually two types of Hoisting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Function Hoisting</strong>: Hoisting has the advantage of allowing you to use a function before
            declaring it in your code as shown in the code snippet given below. Without function hoisting, we would have
            to first write down the function display and only then can we call it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs">display(<span class="hljs-string">"Lion"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">display</span>(<span class="hljs-params">inputString</span>) </span>{
     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(inputString); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'Lion' gets logged </span>
    }</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Variable Hoisting: </strong>You can use a variable in code before it is defined and/or initialised
            because hoisting works with variables as well. JavaScript, however, only hoists declarations, not
            initializations! Even if the variable was initially initialised then defined, or declared and initialised on
            the same line, initialization does not occur until the associated line of code is run. The variable has its
            default initialization till that point in the execution is reached (undefined for a variable declared using
            var, otherwise uninitialized). An example of variable hoisting is shown below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(x) <span class="hljs-comment">// 'undefined' is logged from hoisted var declaration (instead of 7)</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> x <span class="hljs-comment">// Declaration of variable x</span>
    x = <span class="hljs-number">7</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Initialization of variable x to a value 7</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(x); <span class="hljs-comment">// 7 is logged post the line with initialization's execution.</span></code></pre>

    <section class="ibpage-article-header" id="js-closures">
      <h3>10. JavaScript Closures</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>A closure is a function that has been bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surroundings (the
          lexical environment). In other words, a closure allows an inner function to access the scope of an outside
          function. Closures are formed every time a function is created in JavaScript, during function creation time.
          An example of closures in Javascript is given below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">subtractor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">subtractingInteger</span>) </span>{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a</span>) </span>{
       <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a - subtractingInteger;
     };
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> subtract2 = subtractor(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> subtract5 = subtractor(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(subtract2(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>));  <span class="hljs-comment">// 3 is logged</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(subtract5(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>)); <span class="hljs-comment">// 0 is logged</span></code></pre>
        <p>In this example, we have developed a function subtractor(subtractingInteger) that takes a single parameter
          subtractingInteger and returns a new function. Its return function accepts only one input, a, and returns the
          difference of a and subtractingInteger. The function 'subtractor' is essentially a function factory. It
          creates functions that have the ability to subtract a specified value from their arguments. The function
          factory creates two new functions in the example above: one that subtracts 2 from its argument and one that
          subtracts 5 from its arguments. Both subtract2 and subtract5 are closures. They have the same function body
          definition, but they hold lexical surroundings that are distinct. subtractingInteger is 2 in subtract2's
          lexical environment, but subtractingInteger is 5 in subtract5's lexical environment.</p>

      <h3>11. JavaScript Strings</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>As mentioned earlier, Strings are nothing but a combination of characters that can be used to perform a
          variety of tasks. JavaScript provides so many methods for Strings alone that it makes sense to cover Strings
          as a standalone topic in this cheat sheet. Let us now look at the various escape sequences in JavaScript and
          the methods which JavaScript provides for strings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Escape Sequences or Escape Characters: </strong>An escape character is a character in computers and
            telecommunications that causes the following characters in a character sequence to take on a different
            meaning. Metacharacters include escape characters, which are a subset of metacharacters. In general, whether
            something is an escape character or not is determined by the context. For instance, Strings in JavaScript
            are delimited by single or double-quotes. You must use special characters in a string if you want to utilise
            quote marks. A few of the escape characters allowed by JavaScript are as follows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>\' </strong>— Single quotes
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\" </strong>— Double quotes
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\t </strong>— Horizontal tab
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\v</strong> — Vertical tab
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\\</strong> — Backslash
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\b</strong> — Backspace
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\f</strong> — Form feed
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\n</strong> — Newline
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\r </strong>— Carriage return
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>String methods:</strong> As mentioned earlier, JavaScript provides a lot of methods to manipulate
            its Strings. Let us take a look at some of them:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>toLowerCase()</strong> — This method is used for converting strings to lower case
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>toUpperCase()</strong> — This method is used for converting strings to upper case
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>charAt()</strong> — This method is used for returning the character at a particular index of a
                string
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>charCodeAt() </strong>— This method is used for returning to us the Unicode of the character at
                a &nbsp;given index
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>fromCharCode()</strong> — This method is used for returning a string made from a particular
                sequence of UTF-16 code units
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>concat()</strong> — This method is used for concatenating or joining multiple strings into a
                single string
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>match()</strong> — This method is used for retrieving the matches of a string against a pattern
                string which is provided
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>replace()</strong> — This method is used for finding and replacing a given text in the string
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>indexOf() </strong>— This method is used for providing the index of the first appearance of a
                given text inside the string
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>lastIndexOf()</strong> — This method is similar to the indexOf() methods and only differs in the
                fact that it searches for the last occurrence of the character and searches backwards
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>search()</strong> — This method is used for executing a search for a matching text and returning
                the index of the searched string
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>substr()</strong> — &nbsp;This method is pretty much the same as the slice() method but the
                extraction of a substring in it depends on a given number of characters
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>slice()</strong> — This method is used for extracting an area of the string and returning it
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>split()</strong> — This method is used for splitting a string object into an array of strings at
                a particular index
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>substring()</strong> — Even this method is almost the same as the slice() method but it does not
                allow negative positions
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>valueOf()</strong> — This method is used for returning the primitive value (one without any
                properties or methods) of a string object
              </li>

      <h3>13. JavaScript Data Transformation</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Data Transformation in JavaScript can be done with the usage of higher-order functions. Higher-order
          functions are those functions in JavaScript which can accept one or more functions as inputs and return a
          function as the result. All higher-order functions that take a function as input are map(), filter(), and
          reduce(). Let us now take a look at how these functions can be used. One thing to note over here is that
          because all of these functions are part of the JavaScript Array prototype, they can be used directly on an
          array.</p>
        <p><strong>map() method</strong>: The map method applies a function to each array element. The callback function
          receives each element of the array and returns a new array of the same length. This method can be used to
          conduct the same operation/transformation on each element of an array and return a new array with the modified
          values of the same length. An example of the usage of the map() method is given below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-number">30</span>];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> triple  = arr.map(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">x</span> =&gt;</span> x * <span class="hljs-number">3</span>);
    triple; <span class="hljs-comment">// [30,60,90]</span></code></pre>
        <p><strong>filter() method:&nbsp;</strong> Using the filter() method, items that do not meet a criterion are
          removed from the array. The callback function receives every element of the array. If the callback returns
          true on each iteration, the element will be added to the new array; otherwise, it will not be added. An
          example of the usage of the filter() method is given below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">13</span>,<span class="hljs-number">40</span>,<span class="hljs-number">47</span>];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> odd = arr.filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">x</span> =&gt;</span> x % <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    odd; <span class="hljs-comment">// [13,47]</span></code></pre>
        <p><strong>reduce() method: </strong>The reduce() method can combine the items of an array into a single value.
          When using reduce, we must declare the accumulator's beginning value (final result). Each iteration, we do
          some operation inside the callback, which is then added to the accumulator. An example of the usage of the
          reduce() method is given below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">10</span>,<span class="hljs-number">20</span>,<span class="hljs-number">30</span>];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> counter = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> answer = arr.reduce(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">accumulator, value</span>) =&gt;</span> value + accumulator, counter);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(answer) <span class="hljs-comment">// answer = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60</span></code></pre>

      <h3>14. JavaScript Regular Expressions </h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Regular expressions can be defined as search patterns that can be used to match string character
          combinations. Text search and text to replace procedures can both benefit from the search pattern. Let us look
          at how JavaScript allows Regular Expressions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pattern Modifiers</strong>: Following are the pattern modifiers that are allowed in JavaScript:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>e</strong> — &nbsp;This is used for evaluating replacement
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>x</strong> — This is used for allowing comments and whitespace in the pattern
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metacharacters: </strong>Following are the metacharacters that are allowed in JavaScript:<ul>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\b</strong> — This is used for finding matches at the beginning or at the end of a word
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>\B </strong>— This is used for finding matches not at the beginning or at the end of a word

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brackets: </strong>You can group parts of a regular expression together by putting them inside round
            brackets or parentheses. You can use this to apply a quantifier to the entire group or to limit the
            alternation to a specific area of the regex. For grouping, only parenthesis can be used. A character class
            is defined by square brackets, while a quantifier with precise bounds is defined by curly braces. Let us
            look at some of the brackets which JavaScript allows:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>[abc]</strong> — This is used for finding all the characters between the brackets
              </li>

                <strong>(a|b|c)</strong> — This is used for finding all of the alternatives separated with |
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>[A-z]</strong> — This is used for finding each character from uppercase A to lowercase z

      <h3>16. JavaScript Date Objects</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Dates are extremely important to deal with while creating most types of applications. JavaScript also allows
          you to deal with and change dates and times. The next section of the JavaScript cheat sheet is how to work on
          dates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Setting Dates: </strong>Dates can be set using the following three ways:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Date() </strong>— Returns a new date object that contains the current date and time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Date(1993, 6, 19, 5, 12, 50, 32) </strong>— We can create a custom date object with the pattern
                as Year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are represented by the numbers. Except for
                the year and month, we can omit anything we like.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Date("1999-12-22")</strong> — Date as a string declaration
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Getting the values of Time and Date: </strong>The following methods can be used for getting the date
            and time values in JavaScript:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>getDate() </strong>returns the month's day as a number (1-31)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>getTime()</strong> — Get the milliseconds since January 1, 1970
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>getUTCDate() </strong>returns the month's day (day) in the supplied date in universal time (also
                available for day, month, full year, hours, minutes etc.)
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>parse </strong>— &nbsp;It returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 from a string
                representation of a date.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>getDay()</strong> returns a number representing the weekday (0-6)

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Setting a Part of the Dates: </strong>We can set a part of the dates in JavaScript using the
            following methods:<ul>
              <li>
                <strong>setDate()</strong> — Returns the current date as a number (1-31)

                (also available for day, month, full-year, hours, minutes etc.)
              </li>
              <li>

      <h3>19. JavaScript Event Propagation</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Event propagation is a technique that governs how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to reach
          their destination, as well as what happens to them once they arrive. Consider the following scenario: you have
          been given a click event handler to a hyperlink (i.e. &lt;a&gt; element) that's nested inside a paragraph
          (i.e. &lt;p&gt; element). The handler will now be executed if you click on that link. However, if you set the
          click event handler to the paragraph containing the link instead of the link, the handler will be triggered
          regardless of whether the link is clicked. Because events go up and down the DOM tree to reach their target,
          they don't merely affect the target element that triggered the event. This is known as event propagation.</p>
        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75%;">
          <img
            data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/772/original/Event_Propagation_in_JavaScript.png?1644590441"
            class="lazy-elem">
        </figure>
        <p>When an event is fired on an element with parent elements, the above picture shows how the event travels
          through the DOM tree at different stages of the event propagation. Event propagation in current browsers is
          divided into two phases: capturing and bubbling.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Capturing Phase</strong>: In the capturing phase, events propagate from the Window down through
            the DOM tree to the target node. For example, if the user clicks a hyperlink, that click event would pass
            through the &lt;html&gt; element, the &lt;body&gt; element, and the &lt;p&gt; element containing the link.
            Also if any ancestor (i.e. parent, grandparent, etc.) of the target element and the target itself has a
            specially registered capturing event listener for that type of event, those listeners are executed during
            this phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Bubbling Phase: </strong>From the target element up to the Window, the DOM tree visits all of
            the target element's ancestors one by one. When a user hits a hyperlink, the click event passes via the
            &lt;p&gt; element containing the link, the &lt;body&gt; element, the &lt;html&gt; element, and the document
            node, for example. Additionally, if the target element or any of its ancestors have event handlers for that
            sort of event, those handlers are run during this phase. By default, all event handlers in current browsers
            are registered at the bubbling phase.

      <h3>20. Asynchronous JavaScript</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>A number of Web API features now use asynchronous code for running, especially those that access or fetch a
          resource from external devices, for instance, retrieving files from the network, accessing some database and
          returning data to it, accessing a video stream from a webcam, or broadcasting the display to a VR headset.
          There are two ways in which asynchronous coding can be done in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Async Callbacks: </strong>When invoking a function, async callbacks are functions that are passed as
            arguments and begin executing code in the background. When the background code is finished, it runs the
            callback function to notify you that the work is complete or that anything interesting has occurred.
            Callbacks are a little out of date these days, but they're still utilised in a lot of older but still
            popular APIs. The second parameter of the addEventListener() method is an example of an async callback:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs">buton.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
     alert(<span class="hljs-string">'Button has been clicked!'</span>);
     <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> paraElement = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.createElement(<span class="hljs-string">'p'</span>);
     paraElement.textContent = <span class="hljs-string">'A new paragraph.'</span>;
     <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.body.appendChild(paraElement);
    });</code></pre>
        <p>The first parameter specifies the type of event to be listened for, while the second specifies a callback
          function to be called when the event occurs. When we give a callback function as an input to another function,
          we are merely passing the function's reference; the callback function isn't immediately performed. It is
          asynchronously "called back" (thus the name) somewhere within the containing function's body. When the time
          comes, the contained function is in charge of calling the callback function.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Promises: </strong>Promises are a new async programming paradigm that you'll see in current Web
            APIs. The get() API, which is essentially a newer, more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest, is a nice
            example. Let's take a look at an example from our post Fetching data from the server:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs">fetch(items.json<span class="hljs-string">').then(function(res) {
     return res.json();
    }).then(function(json) {
     let item = json;
     initialise(item);
    }).catch(function(e) {
     console.log('</span>Fetch error: <span class="hljs-string">' + e.message);
    });</span></code></pre>
        <p>Here, fetch() takes a single argument: &nbsp;the URL of a network resource we wish to fetch and a promise is
          returned. A promise is an object that represents whether the async operation succeeded or failed. In a sense,
          it reflects a transitional condition. In essence, it's the browser's way of saying, "I promise to respond as
          quickly as I can," hence the name "promise."</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note: Pyramid of Doom, also known as Callback Hell, is an anti-pattern found in asynchronous computer code.
            It is a slang phrase for a large number of interconnected "if" statements or functions. A few callbacks
            appear harmless if you do not expect your application logic to become too sophisticated. However, as your
            project's requirements grow, you will quickly find yourself with layers upon layers of nested callbacks. The
            usage of callbacks makes writing and maintaining code more challenging. It also makes it more difficult to
            identify the application's flow, which is a debugging roadblock, hence the problem's well-known nickname:
            Callback Hell. An example of callback hell is given below:</p>

      <h3>21. JavaScript Memory Allocation and Event Loop</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>In JavaScript, memory allocation is done in the following regions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Heap memory: </strong>Data is stored in random order and memory is allocated accordingly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50%;"><img
            data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/780/original/Heap_memory.png?1644590959"
            class="lazy-elem"></figure>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Stack memory: </strong>Memory that is allocated in stacks. The majority of the time, it's employed
            for functions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50%;"><img
            data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/774/original/Stack_memory.png?1644590594"
            class="lazy-elem"></figure>
        <p>The function stack is a function that maintains track of all other functions that are running at the same
          time. An example to illustrate it is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">second</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"Second"</span>)
    }
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">First</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    second()
    }
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    first()
    }
    foo()</code></pre>
        <p>The order in which functions are executed, that is. when they are popped out of the stack once their purpose
          is completed, is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>console.log</li>
          <li>second</li>
          <li>first</li>
          <li>foo</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Event loop: </strong>An event loop is something that pulls various things like methods, etc. out of
            the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty. The
            event loop is the trick to making JavaScript appear multithreaded even if it is only single-threaded. The
            following illusion clearly explains how the event loop works:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The callback function in the event queue has not yet started and is waiting for its time to be added to the
          stack when SetTimeOut() is called and the Web API waits. The function is loaded onto the stack when the
          function stack becomes empty, as seen below:</p>
        <p>The event loop is used to take the first event from the Event Queue and place it on the stack, which in this
          case is the callback function. If this function is called from here, it will call other functions within it.

      <h3>22. JavaScript Error Handling</h3>
      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>Various types of errors occur when we are coding in JavaScript. There are a few options for dealing with
          them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>try </strong>— We can define a code block for testing errors using the try block.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>catch </strong>— We can set up a block of code to execute in the event of an error using the catch
            statement.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>throw </strong>— Instead of the typical JavaScript errors, we can also create custom error messages
            using the throw statement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>finally </strong>— JavaScript also allows us to run our code regardless of the outcome of try and
            catch.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript possesses its own inbuilt error object which has the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>name</strong> — It is used for setting or returning an error name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>message </strong>— It is used for setting or returning the error message as a string.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are six types of ways in which the error property can return its name. They are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>EvalError </strong>— It indicates that an error has occurred within the eval() method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RangeError</strong> — It indicates that some number is “out of range”.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ReferenceError</strong> — &nbsp;It indicates that an illegal reference was occurring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SyntaxError</strong> — &nbsp;It indicates that a syntax error was occurring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TypeError </strong>— &nbsp;It indicates that a type error was occurring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>URIError</strong> — &nbsp;It indicates that an encodeURI() error was occurring.

      <article class="ibpage-article">
        <p>ECMAScript 5 (ES5P): Because it was launched in 2009, ES5 is also known as ECMAScript 2009. It has functions
          where developers concentrate on how items are created. In ES5, you must use the function keyword and return to
          define the function, just as you would in any other JavaScript language.</p>
        <p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6): Because it was launched in 2015, ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015. Its class allows
          developers to create an object with the new operator and an arrow function if they don't need to use the
          function keyword to specify the function, and they can also avoid using the return keyword to get the computer
          value.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>As a programming language, JavaScript is gaining popularity. Because of its proven track record and benefits,
          it is becoming the language of choice for developing web properties. JavaScript based libraries like React,
          Angular, Nest, etc. are becoming popular day by day because of the ease with which they allow users to use
          JavaScript to build applications. We have compiled several of the most basic and important operators,
          functions, principles, and methods in the JavaScript cheat sheet above. It gives both experienced developers
          and beginners a good introduction of the language and serves as a reference. We hope you found it informative.
